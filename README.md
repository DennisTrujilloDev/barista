The perfect web application for a cafe, where the barista can log in to check the orders input by the cashier, then update their status to complete once the order has been fulfilled.

# <strong>How It's Made:</strong>
<strong>Tech used</strong>: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, HTML, JS, Node.js, CSS

This application was made by first inputting data from a form into a database. We then update the orders by clicking the ones that have been completed, triggering an update on MongoDB. The data that has the key/value pair of completed: true (as opposed to the boolean value false) is then transferred over to another list.  

# <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong>
While creating this application, I learned about a variety of different Mongo methods that can be used to filter through and delete data from the database.
